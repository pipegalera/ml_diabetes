# Deep Neural Nets & Gradient Boosted Trees for Diabetes Prediction

The purpose of this experiment is comparing the performance metrics of different non-parametric models predicting Diabetes using public [NHANES data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm).

## Deel Learning Models.

### TabPFN

- Paper: [TabPFN: A Transformer That Solves Small Tabular Classification Problems in a Second](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01848)
- Code: https://github.com/automl/TabPFN

"it doesnâ€™t require training, hyperparameter tuning, or cross-validation â€“ it only requires a single forward pass on a new training set. The caveat is that it requires synthetic datasets for the prior." (https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/deep-learning-for-tabular-data.html)

### TabNet
