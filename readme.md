# Deep Neural Nets & Gradient Boosted Trees for Diabetes Prediction

The purpose of this experiment is:

1) Replicating the scarce literature on the topic.

2) Compare the ability of non-parametric models predicting Diabetes based on survey and lab public medical data from different sources:

- [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm). US Population.
- [DRYAD](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ft8750v). China Population.

## Literature on the topic

- Cahn et al. (2020): [Prediction of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes: Development and validation of a machine learning model](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dmrr.3252)

🚧 Preliminary notes:

- What blood pressure readings are taking (1rst, 2nd, 3rd) ?

## 1. Replication

*reverse-chronological for current relevance*

### 1.1 Matabuena et al. (2024)

🚧 Preliminary notes:

- **The paper uploaded to arxiv is an old pre-print, the points below will be probably addressed in the final journal submission**

- Race was mentioned but not added in any model.
- It would be good to see overfitting the training data to make sure the problem is solvable in the first place by the network
- Not specified:

      - Benchmark.
      - Why NNs and not other non-parametric methods that [are usually better for tabular data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998482).
      - Why they choose the specific NN architecture (rather generic?)
      - Number of epochs. Needs a Train/Val viz at least?
      ![](https://i.sstatic.net/qBhX6.png)
      - Why they choose that CV strategy.
      - Why only using data from 2011 to 2014.
      - How they've created the 5011 cohort used for the analysis.

- Cross-Entropy [is not a metric](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/proper-metric-cross-entropy.html). Metrics are functions that measures quality of the model prediction. E.g. It can be the case that the loss change but identify the same number of true labels.

## 2. Model Comparison

🚧 Preliminary notes:

- Need a basic standarized methodology to ensure that methods are on a somewhat level playing field - E.g.NNs performace bastly depend on number of layers and epochs trained on.
- It cannot be compared a deep NN trained for days with a 5-min trainned default XGB. It sounds obvious but it can be the case as the papers do not specify how train the models or for how long (e.g. Dihn et al., 2019). Maybe the reviwers at the time were not familiar with Neural Networks.

"it doesn’t require training, hyperparameter tuning, or cross-validation – it only requires a single forward pass on a new training set. The caveat is that it requires synthetic datasets for the prior." (https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/deep-learning-for-tabular-data.html)
